    <h1>School age children are busy searching the world. We help them to navigate it.</h1>

    <p>
      Your child spends most of their time at school – learning, juggling friendships, doing assigned work and reading – and need an educational
      outlet that puts the power in their hands to explore the educational world in a
      less stressful manner. That&apos;s where Caring Child steps in! Our after school program allows your child to further their learning
      experience in a fun and interactive manner that helps to enhance what they&apos;ve been
      learning in school. We strive to nudge your child to enjoy learning through lessons that offer a bit of creative freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Caring Child, we understand the need for your children to develop reading and writing comprehension and skills. To achieve this,
      all of our centers have their own libraries &#40;Courtesy of Greenaway Library&#41; filled with books centered for children of various ages.
    </p>

    <p>
      Caring Child also participates in a Pen Pal Program, allowing your child to connect with other children
      around the world, and learn of other cultures around them while improving their writing abilities.
    </p>

    <p>A lot of children learn best from hands on activities. At Caring Child, we aren&apos;t short of those!</p>

    <p>
      Through the Hands On! Program, your child will explore difference science activities that encourage
      your child to ask the &quot;why&apos;s&quot; and &quot;how&apos;s&quot; of the world. Does the brand of
      vinegar and baking soda produce different results in a paper mâché volcano? What kind of paper airplane design
      flies best? Does the type of paper matter? Who was the first person to climb Mount Everest? Who holds the most gold medals in the Olympics?
    </p>

    <p>
      These experiences help your child develop concepts related to the learning experience and
      teaches them valuable skills in discovery that they may have not developed otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Caring Child&apos;s Hands On! Program offers plenty of creative opportunity for your child
      to grow. Through arts and crafts projects ranging from simple colouring pages, to
      clay sculptures, or interactive plays – your child will learn to flex
      their creative muscles into integral learning experiences. Whether it be through a paper medium, a play, or even photography,
      your child will have ample opportunity to learn and grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      We strive to seamlessly blend technology into the day as an extension to the learning process. Classrooms are equipped with state
      of the art equipment, including interactive white boards, tablets, and computers to help your
      child learn better, at the direction and guidance of the teacher.
    </p>

    <p>
      Character education is important regardless of age. That&apos;s why at Caring Child Daycare, we integrate character education into all of our
      curricula. Activities at this stage largely consists of cooperation among the children in our centers. Our after school program is broken into
      smaller groups &#40;usually consisting of 10 to 12 children, depending on enrollment sizes&#41;, that allows teachers to guide your child in
      both individually and in groups to work towards the completion of different projects. Each month,
      we focus on different positive attributes such as honesty, kindness, generosity, and more.
    </p>

    <p>Our children are our future, and we at Caring Child strive to help them grow into the best people they can be.</p>
