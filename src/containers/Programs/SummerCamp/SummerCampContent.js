      Camp Wannahawk is a private summer camp offered through Caring Child Daycare centers for school aged children who have completed kindergarten
      all the way through age 12. It boasts a range of activities including swimming at our private lake,
      special interests groups, arts, crafts, and science projects, field trips, and more! It is designed to
      offer age-appropriate learning activities to prepare your child for the grade ahead while having fun.

    <p>
      Camp Wannahawk is a 10 week program starting shortly after school lets out for the summer. Our centers serve as base camps, and provide
      transportation to and from activities. Most camp activities run from 9 am to 5:30 pm. Our centers open at the regular hours of 6 am to 6 pm.

    <p>
      Caring Child also partners with other summer camps in the area to provide the &quot;traditional&quot;
      summer camp experience with camp ground lodging and more. Feel free to contact the director of your center to learn more.
