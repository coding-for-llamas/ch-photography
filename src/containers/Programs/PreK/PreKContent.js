    <h1>By 4 years old, children are preparing to enter school. We guide them to make sure they&apos;re ready.</h1>

    <p>
      Caring Child Daycare is, by all accounts, a tight-knit community where your growing 4 year old
      can prepare to enter kindergarten in the coming year. Expanding upon our Caring Child Educational Formula,
      your child will learn areas of math, science, vocabulary, and social skills in order to best prepare them for their upcoming school year.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your child will continue to learn throughout the day while they work at their own pace,
      interacting with their teachers and their peers. We understand 4 year olds are eager to learn new things –
      At Caring Child Daycare, we believe every task can be a learning experience! That&apos;s why we take your
      child&apos;s individual needs into consideration when developing personalized activities to better their growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      At 4, your child is beginning to realize they can string together letters into words and words into complete
      sentences. They&apos;ll practice their writing skills by writing their name, and simple words. They will even sing,
      recite poems, and share stories about things happening in their lives. We&apos;ll be there every step of the way to encourage their growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      In our Private Pre-K, your child will learn a variety of mathematical skills.
      From making graphs, to simple addition, and completing simple patterns, your child will make
      connections that will help them to better understand the world around them.
    </p>

    <p>
      At 4 years old, children are naturally curious about the world around them. That&apos;s why we created  science portion for the Caring Child
      Educational Formula. Your child will make observations, chart the weather, and identify
      the seasons and their differences. They&apos;ll learn about
      growth through planting seeds and recording the different stages of its growing cycle and
      learn the important of recycling and keeping the earth clean.
    </p>

    <p>
      By 4, children begin to really understand the meaning of friendship. They give each other hugs,
      start to identify their feelings, and sit with their arms around each other while reading.
      At Caring Child Daycare, we encourage children to discuss their
      emotions with one another, talk to their friends about why they&apos;re friends,
      and explore an enthusiasm for meeting new people and new things.
    </p>

    <p>
      Toddlers typically have good control over their fine motor skills by the age of 4. They&apos;re able to use crayons to write letters and words,
      zip and button their own clothes, and serve themselves during dinner.
    </p>

    <p>
      We&apos;ll help them to further develop these skills through all areas of learning – both inside and outside
      of the classroom. Whether that&apos;s your child chasing their friends, and climbing on the jungle gym, or them colouring a picture during art
      class, or on the side walk, there&apos;s many opportunities for your child to continue to learn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Character education is important regardless of age. That&apos;s why at Caring Child Daycare, we integrate character
      education into all of our curricula. Activities at this stage largely consists of cooperation among the children in our centers. Our after
      school program is broken into smaller groups &#40;usually consisting of 10 to 12 children, depending on enrollment sizes&#41;, that
      allows teachers to guide your child in both individually and in groups to work towards the completion of different projects. Each month, we
      focus on different positive attributes such as honesty, kindness, generosity, and more.
