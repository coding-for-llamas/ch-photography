    <h1>Caring Child Daycare Curricula</h1>

    <h2>Infant &#38; Toddler, Twos, Preschool Curriculum</h2>

    <p>
      As a means of freeing up time and providing better care, we at Caring Child Daycare teamed up with leaders of the
      educational field &#45; investing anywhere between &#36;50,000 and &#36;75,000 a year &#45;
      in order to bring your child the best experiences they can get.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Caring Child Educational Formula was written in collaboration with industry leader of childhood education, Herthcock LLC. CCEF is a
      guide for the daily curriculum of our early childhood classrooms. It is designed
      to assist our teachers with planning your child&apos;s day in a way that helps them to enhance
      emerging skills in all areas of development. The activities it offers helps in group time,
      play, and everyday learning
      for your child. It also helps our teachers to better prepare your child&apos;s day, allowing more time for learning and interaction.
    </p>

    <p>All of this takes the stress off the teachers and gives them more time to meet your child&apos;s individual needs.</p>

    <p>
      Our curriculum is centered around month long blocks of time, each based around themes. Our teachers are free to add on their own ideas,
      expanding lessons creatively &#45; CCEF is built strategically to allow for growth where necessary,
      while providing the core components for a well&#45;rounded education. From infancy
      through preschool, your child will will learn through attention grabbing activities best suited to prepare them for later life.
    </p>

    <h2>Pre-K Curriculum</h2>

    <p>
      All Natural Teaching &#40;ANT&#41; is a comprehensive curriculum designed with pre&#45;k in mind. Our
      carefully devised curriculum was designed to
      cover all areas of early learning for your young ones. Each unit is designed around daily
      routine to make every day a learning experience that will benefit your child when it comes time
      to enter school for the first time. Themes, skills, concepts,
      and more have been developed in collaboration with leaders in childhood education, based around both children&apos;s
      fiction and age-appropriate non-fiction trade books. It&apos;s designed to make it easy for children to learn and teachers to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through small groups, conversations, stories, word play, and more &#45; your child will learn
      everything they will need to succeed when it comes time to start their formal education.
    </p>

    <h2>After School Curriculum</h2>

    <p>
      Our after school curriculum is heavily based around building on the six pillars of character &#45; as listed out
      by the Character Counts! Coalition.
    </p>

    <p>
      As children are not born with good character, teachers and staff will work by example to teach
      children how to behave. Children best learn through direct teaching and observation of those around them, after all!
    </p>

    <p>
      The Character Counts! Program guides adults in teaching children about the six Pillars of Ethics. That is, it teaches them about
      responsibility, respect, caring, fairness, trustworthiness, and citizenship &#45; in an age appropriate manner. The program provides a
      unified approach that builds upon itself.
    </p>
