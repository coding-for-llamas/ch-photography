    <h1>Exceptional Care That Matters</h1>

    <p>
      There are many things that make Caring Child Daycare different from other facilities.
      Between our personal standards of care, increased security, and high
      standards, there&apos;s a lot to bring to the table. There are unique perks that you as a parent
      will receive by joining the Caring Child Daycare family.
    </p>

    <h2>Communication</h2>

    <p>
      All of our centers at Caring Child Daycare provide feedback to parents. Whether this be
      weekly reports, or just general information for upcoming events, you will never be out of the loop with your child&apos;s overall progression.
    </p>

    <h2>Free Diapers, Wipes, and Formula</h2>

    <p>
      Button&apos;s Baby Needs products are supplied to any and all infants and young toddlers while
      at our centers as a value incentive &#40;and for peace of mind&#41; to parents. This is included
      in your tuition. We also provide the option to have formula supplied to
      your baby for feedings, free of charge.
    </p>

    <h2>Supper for Children in Need</h2>

    <p>
      At Caring Child, we understand times can are tough for many in the area. For working class
      parents, there&apos;s sometimes not enough hours in the day.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a part of our Financial Relief System, we offer parents the option to have their child provided
      supper during the times they are at our centers.
      While this is included as a standard for any child that stays past 4 pm â€“ feel free to
      talk to a member of staff to have a packed meal provided for supper at
      home if needed. No child deserves to go hungry, and parents shouldn&apos;t have to worry about where
      their children&apos;s next meal is going to come from.
    </p>

    <h2>Staff Experience</h2>

    <p>All told, the staff at Caring Child Daycare have a combined 478 years of experience.</p>

    <h2>Availability and Flexibility</h2>

    <p>
      Caring Child Daycare is open 6:30 am to 6:30 pm Monday through Friday. Parent&apos;s can count
      on us to be open during inclement weather&#42;. We do close for a few major holidays &#40;New Years Day,
      Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas&#41;, but we strive to be open as frequently as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#42;Our goal is to open all of our Centers on time, however, if weather conditions make it
      impossible for staff to safely arrive at the center, we&apos;ll be forced to open a bit later, close a
      bit early, or close for the day entirely. In cases where we have to
      change our schedule &#40;following Government issued warnings&#41;, we&apos;ll notify parents ahead of time.
      Please understand, this is for the safety of parents, their children, and our staff.
    </p>

    <h2>Summer Camp Fun</h2>

    <p>
      Caring Child offers a summer camp program for children in our centers. Activities include
      skill building, improvements in social interaction, and more! Camp Wannnahawk is here to
      provide education and fun through camp activities to keep your
      child learning even when school is not in session.
    </p>

    <p>Camp Wannahawk is available for school students who have completed Kindergarten, all the way to 12 years of age.</p>
