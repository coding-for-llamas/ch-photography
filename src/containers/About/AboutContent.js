    <h1>Our Mission</h1>

    <p>
      Caring Child Daycare exists for a simple purpose: to extend a helping hand to parents to
      ensure the nurturing growth of your children. At Caring Child,
      we believe there is no greater honor than ensuring that every child has a fighting chance to
      receive the brightest future available to them. We at Caring Child are dedicated to providing
      a nurturing environment for your child to grow into the highest potential they have.
    </p>

    <h2>We are educators, nurturers, and leaders.</h2>

    <p>
      It takes a village to raise a child. At Caring Child, we bring that expertise to you.
      For over 35 years, Caring Child has been providing children, both young
      and old, with quality education while offering families the peace of mind of knowing that they are receiving exceptional, quality care.
    </p>

    <p>
      Caring Child Daycare offers childcare to children from 6 weeks to 12 years of age. Our centers
      open at 6:30 am and offer extended hours to bring convenience to
      working parents. At Caring Child, we take safety and security seriously. All of our centers are
      equipped with top of the line security features including coded front
      doors and finger print scanners at check-in. All of our members of staff are certified in CPR and
      first aid and are provided continuous education in safety training.
    </p>

    <p>
      We teach based on nationally accredited curricula that will ensure your child receives a
      great head start in their learning. On top of that, your child
      will also have access to the latest technology to help them excel. All of our
      centers are equipped with iPads and Smart Boards so children can learn and
      play regardless of their age or ability.
    </p>

    <p>
      We understand that finding the best childcare facility is a huge decision. We here at Caring Child invite you to take a tour of our
      facilities at any time so you can experience first hand what we can provide to you and your family.
