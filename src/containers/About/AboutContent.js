    <div className="about-content">
      <p>Caledonia Hanson was born on the historic road of Route 66 in Arizona and was raised in the heart of Orange County.</p>

      <p>
        A graduate of the Orange County High School of the Arts for Film and TV, Caleodnia has continued her
        passion for film and photography and doesn&apos;t limit herself to traditional shoots.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can find her in the heart of an abandoned building digging up lost history, traveling the
        world with her camera, and taking risks to better herself as a person and an artist when she&apos;s
        not spending her time making her models feel like royalty.
