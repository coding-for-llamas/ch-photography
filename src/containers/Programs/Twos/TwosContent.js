    <h1>Children explore. We lead.</h1>

    <p>
      At Caring Child, we know caring and learning go hand in hand. That&apos;s why our staff strive to provide the most comprehensive learning and
      supportive environment available. Children are able to learn throughout the day because  at our centers, the opportunity is always present.
    </p>

    <p>
      Children learn from the time they enter our centers at the beginning of the day until the time they leave. Throughout the day, they&apos;ll
      interact with staff and other children both individually and in small to large groups. They&apos;ll have the opportunity to learn and discover
      in our developmentally appropriate learning centers as well as our age-appropriate play grounds.
    </p>

    <p>Our curriculum for your two year old is designed to help them explore and learn while being as independent as possible.</p>

    <p>
      At two years old, children are constantly practicing and expanding upon their vocabulary. That&apos;s why we here at Caring Child
      Daycare give them ample opportunity to develop those skills through singing, chanting, and putting on
      finger plays. Children are also encouraged to read age-appropriate books
      from our library center, and retell the stories through pictures and felt boards. All of this helps in encouraging their
      <b>&nbsp;language arts skills.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Teachers engage children in counting and identifying numbers in order to develop their
      <b>&nbsp;mathematics&nbsp;</b>
      skills. They&apos;ll also encourage your
      young ones in activities that help them to build one on one correspondence, recognizing shapes, and measuring different objects with various
      standards &#40;such as with rulers, thermometers, and tape measures&#41; as well as non-standard measurements
      &#40;like paper clips and hands, and foot prints.&#41;
    </p>

    <p>
      Children will further their independence through practicing their
      <b>&nbsp;motor controls</b>
      . By learning to eat with a fork and spoon, they&apos;ll develop and
      enhance their fine motor controls during family-style meals. For gross motor control at this age, they&apos;ll get to begin practicing writing,
      using scissors, and completing age-appropriate puzzles. The learning doesn&apos;t just have
      to be in the classroom, though. It&apos;ll continue as they go outside to play on our age-appropriate playgrounds. Whether
      kicking a ball, or running around and climbing, there&apos;s always an opportunity to learn at Caring Child Daycare.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Character education&nbsp;</b>
      is important regardless of age. That&apos;s why at Caring Child Daycare, we integrate character education into
      all of our curricula. Activities at this stage largely consists of cooperation among the children in our centers. Our after school program
      is broken into smaller groups &#40;usually consisting of 10 to 12 children, depending on enrollment sizes&#41;,
      that allows teachers to guide your child in both individually and in groups to work towards the completion of different projects. Each month,
      we focus on different positive attributes such as honesty, kindness, generosity, and more.
