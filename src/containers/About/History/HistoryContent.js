    <h1>Our History. Your Future.</h1>

    <p>
      Caring Child Daycare was started with a simple goal in mind: to shape the lives and education
      of the children in the Greater Roanoke Valley for the better.
    </p>

    <p>
      When founder Jimmy J. Cricket learned of the costs of then modern-day daycare prices &#40;something
      which still plagues many working class parents today&#41;,
      he set about to build a
      system of schools that could take the burden and worry off parent&apos;s minds while benefiting children for years to come.
    </p>

    <p>
      Caring Child started off small, taking donations from family and local neighborhood friends &#40;as
      well as a loan that Mr. Cricket took at his own risk&#41;, but it has grown into something wonderful.
      As of now, we have three fully staffed centers filled with caring providers attending the needs of children and parents alike.
    </p>

    <p>
      It has been many years in the making, but Caring Child has grown from a small dream into a
      successful business and seen thousands of children and families grow. At Caring Child, your family is our
      family and your child&apos;s education is our priority. We may have grown, but our vision is still the same.
