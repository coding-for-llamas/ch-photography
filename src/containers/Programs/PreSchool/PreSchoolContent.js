    <h1>At 3, children are discovering the world around them. We encourage them in their exploration.</h1>

    <p>
      Our preschool curriculum is designed to inspire children to explore their surroundings, and progress at their own pace. Your children will be
      encouraged to discover their own style, create opportunities, accomplish simple tasks, and learn many new skills. Here at Caring Child
      Daycare, your children learn throughout the day, including playtime, because every experience is a learning experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this age, life is both exciting and challenging. Children are naturally curious, take pride in doing things independently, and thrive on
      praise. They&apos;re building language as well as nonverbal communication, and further
      developing their fine and gross motor skills. We took all of
      that into considering when creating this portion of the Caring Child Educational Formula.
    </p>

    <p>
      Language development doesn&apos;t stop in preschool â€“ We&apos;ll help your child to further their written and spoken
      education through singing, story-telling, and simple rhymes. They&apos;ll be read age-appropriate books from our well stocked library, and
      retell those stories through drawings and other mediums. Your children will be encouraged to ask questions and share ideas about what it is
      they&apos;re learning. Dramatic play, blocks, and transportation are just a few examples of how they&apos;ll develop through play.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Caring Child Daycare, our curriculum features activities written to give children
      the opportunity to begin solving simple math problems through counting blocks and beads. Teachers will also work
      with them to identify similarities and differences within groups of objects. All of this will help further develop their
      <b>&nbsp;mathematics skills.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Children at Caring Child Daycare are given the opportunity to practice through observation. They&apos;ll learn to enhance their problem solving
      skills through simple experiments like observing what happens when a piece of paper is dipped into red food colouring. They&apos;ll learn about
      different plants, animals, and the weather. They&apos;ll also learn about different parts of the human body, such as the eyes, ears, and nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caring Child Daycare provides an optimal place for your child to learn to share, take turns, learn, and play.
      In our learning centers,
      they&apos;ll have the opportunity to engage in many activities with friends. Our teachers will be there to help develop a
      better understanding of sense of self, and provide a learned example of how to properly
      express their emotions. All of this helps them to develop their
      <b>&nbsp;social and emotional skills.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Your child will have plenty of opportunities to work on their
      <b>&nbsp;gross and fine motor controls&nbsp;</b>
      at Caring Child Daycare. Whether walking a straight line, jumping, throwing a ball and catching it, or balancing and hopping on one foot,
      there&apos;s many activities planned for your child&apos;s day. Our teachers will encourage confidence,
      give support and help give your child the motivation needed to continue developing new skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Character education&nbsp;</b>
      is important regardless of age. That&apos;s why at Caring Child Daycare, we integrate
      character education into all of our curricula. Activities at
      this stage largely consists of cooperation among the children in our centers. Our after school program is broken into smaller groups
      &#40;usually consisting of 10 to 12 children, depending on enrollment sizes&#41;, that allows teachers to guide your child in both
      individually and in groups to work towards the completion of different projects. Each month, we focus on different positive
      attributes such as honesty, kindness, generosity, and more.
