    <h1>Infants and Toddlers have their own individual personalities.</h1>
    <h2>We bring them to the surface.</h2>

    <p>
      Through a unique blend of teaching and nurturing, we&apos;ll help to prepare your child to enter school life later in life. Early education
      is important, and we at Caring Child Daycare will help your young ones to prepare for preschool and beyond.
    </p>

    <p>
      Teachers take the time to bond and develop trust with your children. We believe this trust
      is an important stepping stone to allow for caregivers
      at Caring Child to help guide your child&apos;s early development. Individual caregivers are also the main point of contact for you, the parent.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Caring Child Daycare, we understand that each child&apos;s needs will be different, which is
      why we change curriculum slightly to accommodate each child&apos;s
      individual needs. As a base, we follow the Caring Child Educational Formula to help
      ensure your child is prepared for life. This formula includes
      areas of childhood development such as: cognitive development, communication, emotional
      development and health, fine motor control and skill, gross motor control and skill, and social skills.
    </p>

    <h2>Infants – Aged 6 weeks to 12 months.</h2>

    <p>
      The Caring Child Educational Formula for infants is designed to help them develop the cognitive, emotional, social, and physical motor skills
      they&apos;ll need to prepare for preschool and beyond. We use a unique blend of teaching exercises to help
      your child learn in a way that makes sense and utilizes the way infants best learn.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Cognitive skills&nbsp;</b>
      include helping your infants to build positive memories, learning to develop words, and learning recognition. Infants at this
      age explore the world with their hands and mouths. In our customized infant room, your
      child will learn through different textures, playing games such as peek-a-boo, and completing simple puzzles.
    </p>

    <p>
      For helping your child to develop
      <b>communication skills&nbsp;</b>
      , our teachers will take time reading to your child, singing songs, and putting on
      puppet shows. Your infant will learn to communicate their wants and needs in no time!
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Emotional development and health&nbsp;</b>
      is important for everyone, and that&apos;s no different for infants. By feeling safe and secure with the caregivers
      in their lives, your child will learn to build trust and attachments. We at Caring Child Daycare will help to develop your child&apos;s trust
      through watching for common body language, and responding as necessary. Through cradling hugs,
      and gentle responses about the world around them, your child will be set to grow emotionally.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Fine motor skills&nbsp;</b>
      are developed through exercises of the small muscle groups, like the fingers and hands. Our centers use a range of
      techniques to help your baby exercise these muscle groups in order to build muscle memory and connections to better use them. These include,
      but are not limited to, giving them small foods on the tray and helping them to pick them
      up to feed themselves, playing with clay, waving hello and goodbye, and giving them toys to play with that are designed to be easy to grasp.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gross motor development&nbsp;</b>
      is focused on core large muscle groups like those in the arms and legs. For infants, this also includes muscles in the
      neck that help them to hold their heads up, roll over, pull themselves up,
      and crawl. At Caring Child, we provide your infant with exercises that will
      help them to develop these core groups, ranging from play time on their tummy, infant dance, and taking them on walks around the centers.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Social development&nbsp;</b>
      is important for all age groups. For infants, this mainly consists of
      smiling and making eye contact, imitating facial expression, and
      learning to bond through close proximity. With Caring Child, your infant will see many
      different, consistent people, and build a bond with them, through our staff. They will also spend
      time plying with friends in their age-range in age appropriate classrooms to build the early bond of friendships.
    </p>

    <h2>Toddlers – Aged 13 months to 24 months</h2>

    <p>
      Similar to infants, we focus on six main areas of learning to help further expand and build upon the early development
      of your child. At this stage, your child is further refining and developing key skills they&apos;ll need later in life in order to succeed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our expert teachers help to guide your toddlers all the while letting them lead the way to make their own choices. With the Caring Child
      Educational Formula, your child will learn throughout the day things that lessons that reinforce what they are taught at home. We shine light on
      teachable moments while your toddler plays, helping them to learn throughout the day.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Cognitive Skills &nbsp;</b>
      at this age include learning new vocabulary words, perfecting movement through their environment, and forming connections with
      other people. The All Natural Teaching curriculum focuses on establishing connections through song, books, games, and more. We encourage your
      child to build their knowledge by building their education – naming colors, objects, and people.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this stage in life, your toddler will begin to use words to express both their needs and identity. The teachers at our centers will help
      your child to develop their
      <b>communication skills&nbsp;</b>
      through increasing your child&apos;s vocabulary. Our teachers lead by example, practicing good
      manners such as saying please and thank you, welcoming guests that come into the room,
      and encouraging your child to do the same. They&apos;ll help
      your child build connections to what objects are by stating the name of an object and having your child repeat it when they point at something.
      Children learn through example, and our teachers are here to set good examples.
    </p>

    <p>
      Toddler&apos;s
      <b>&nbsp;emotional development&nbsp;</b>
      largely involves feeling safe with where they&apos;re at. They&apos;ll develop strong bonds with their teachers and
      experience a wide variety of emotions. Our staff will talk to your child about their feelings,
      and will help discuss what others may be feeling as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Fine motor skills&nbsp;</b>
      are developed through exercises of the small muscle groups, like the fingers and hands. At Caring Child Daycare, we encourage
      your toddler to do things on their own, like washing their hands, or using a fork and spoon to feed themselves, in order to develop those
      skills. Toddlers will have many opportunities throughout the day to practice these skills. Our
      staff will encourage your child to work at their own pace to feel successful as they develop these skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gross motor development&nbsp;</b>
      is focused on core large muscle groups like those in the arms and legs. Because toddlers love to climb, we
      provide safe, age-appropriate areas for them to do so on our outdoor playground. For older toddlers,
      we have games of catch to work on their throwing and catching skills, and hand-eye coordination.
    </p>

    <p>
      Toddlers start engaging in longer periods of play, but they&apos;re still frequently check in to make sure an adult is close by.
      They&apos;re not always willing to share toys, and tend to be sensitive. At Caring Child Daycare, we use
      <b>&nbsp;social skills&nbsp;</b>
      activities to teach your child to share
      and learn to respect others. Your child will learn to take turns with toys, stacking blocks,
      assisting other children and teachers with cleaning up, and playing games like follow the leader.
